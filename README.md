# SQL

## Why Does SQL Even exist?

Imagine a company runs an application. For example, Amazon

Users:
- Sign up
- But products
- Cancel Subscriptions
- Click Buttons

All these actions generate DATA.

Now Amazon wants to answer questions like:
- How much revenue did we make this month?
- Which customers buy the most?
- Why are users leaving?

As of early 2026, Amazon has 150 Million active customers in India.
But the maximum number of rows Excel can store is 1,048,576 rows. So, technically, all this data cannot be stored in a Excel file.
